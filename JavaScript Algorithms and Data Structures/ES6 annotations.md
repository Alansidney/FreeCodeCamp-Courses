# ECMAScript 6

## What is it?

ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable.

Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year.

ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language.

## Mutate an Array Declared with const

Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using const by default, unless they know they will need to reassign the value. Only in that case, they use let.

However, it is important to understand that objects (including arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using const are still mutable. Using the const declaration only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier.

```JavaScript
const s = [5, 6, 7];
s = [1, 2, 3];
s[2] = 45;
console.log(s);
```

s = [1, 2, 3] will result in an error. The console.log will display the value [5, 6, 45].

## Prevent Object Mutation

To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected, with an error thrown if the script is running in strict mode.

```JavaScript
let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
```

The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.

## Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions

In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.

To achieve this, we often use the following syntax:

```JS
const myFunc = function() {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```

ES6 provides us with the syntactic sugar to not have to write anonymous functions this way. Instead, you can use arrow function syntax:

```JS
const myFunc = () => {
  const myVar = "value";
  return myVar;
}
```

When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allows you to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into one-line statements:

```JS
const myFunc = () => "value";
```

This code will still return the string value by default.

## Write Arrow Functions with Parameters

Just like a regular function, you can pass arguments into an arrow function.

```Js
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
doubler(4);
doubler(4) would return the value 8.

```
If an arrow function has a single parameter, the parentheses enclosing the parameter may be omitted.

const doubler = item => item * 2;
It is possible to pass more than one argument into an arrow function.

```Js
const multiplier = (item, multi) => item * multi;
multiplier(4, 2);
```

multiplier(4, 2) would return the value 8.

## Set Default Parameters for Your Functions

In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces default parameters for functions.

Check out this code:
```JS
const greeting = (name = "Anonymous") => "Hello " + name;

console.log(greeting("John"));
console.log(greeting());
```

The console will display the strings Hello John and Hello Anonymous.

The default parameter kicks in when the argument is not specified (it is undefined). As you can see in the example above, the parameter name will receive its default value Anonymous when you do not provide a value for the parameter. You can add default values for as many parameters as you want.

## Use the Rest Parameter with Function Parameters

n order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest parameter for function parameters. With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:

```JS
function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2));
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { }));
```

The console would display the strings You have passed 3 arguments. and You have passed 4 arguments..

The rest parameter eliminates the need to check the args array and allows us to apply map(), filter() and reduce() on the parameters array.

## Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place

ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

The ES5 code below uses apply() to compute the maximum value in an array:
```JS
var arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.
```

We had to use Math.max.apply(null, arr) because Math.max(arr) returns NaN. Math.max() expects comma-separated arguments, but not an array. The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.

```JS
const arr = [6, 89, 3, 45];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr);
maximus would have a value of 89.
```

...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the array. However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument to a function or in an array literal. The following code will not work:

```JS
const spreaded = ...arr;
```

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects

Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:

```JS
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
```

name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

```JS
const { name, age } = user;
```

Again, name would have a value of the string John Doe, and age would have the number 34.

Here, the name and age variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects

Using an object similar to previous examples:

```JS
const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};
```

Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:

```JS

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
```

And here's how you can assign an object properties' values to variables with different names:

```JS
const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;
```

## Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays

ES6 makes destructuring arrays as easy as destructuring objects.

One key difference between the spread operator and array destructuring is that the spread operator unpacks all contents of an array into a comma-separated list. Consequently, you cannot pick or choose which elements you want to assign to variables.

Destructuring an array lets us do exactly that:
```JS
const [a, b] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b);
```

The console will display the values of a and b as 1, 2.

The variable a is assigned the first value of the array, and b is assigned the second value of the array. We can also access the value at any index in an array with destructuring by using commas to reach the desired index:

```JS
const [a, b,,, c] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a, b, c);
```

The console will display the values of a, b, and c as 1, 2, 5.

## Use Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements

In some situations involving array destructuring, we might want to collect the rest of the elements into a separate array.

The result is similar to Array.prototype.slice(), as shown below:

```JS
const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b);
console.log(arr);
The console would display the values 1, 2 and [3, 4, 5, 7].
```

Variables a and b take the first and second values from the array. After that, because of the rest parameter's presence, arr gets the rest of the values in the form of an array. The rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list. As in, you cannot use the rest parameter to catch a subarray that leaves out the last element of the original array.

Use destructuring assignment with the rest parameter to perform an effective Array.prototype.slice() so that arr is a sub-array of the original array source with the first two elements omitted.


## Use Destructuring Assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters

In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.

Consider the code below:

```JS
const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;

}
```

This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

```JS
const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {

}
```

When profileData is passed to the above function, the values are destructured from the function parameter for use within the function.

## Create Strings using Template Literals

A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.

Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

Consider the code below:
```JS
const person = {
  name: "Zodiac Hasbro",
  age: 56
};

const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
I am ${person.age} years old.`;

console.log(greeting);
```

The console will display the strings Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro! and I am 56 years old..

A lot of things happened there. Firstly, the example uses backticks (`), not quotes (' or "), to wrap the string. Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the output. This saves inserting \n within strings. The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with ${ and }. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, for example ${a + b}. This new way of creating strings gives you more flexibility to create robust strings.

## Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6

When defining functions within objects in ES5, we have to use the keyword function as follows:
```JS
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```

With ES6, you can remove the function keyword and colon altogether when defining functions in objects. Here's an example of this syntax:

```JS
const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};
```
## Use class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function

ES6 provides a new syntax to create objects, using the class keyword.

It should be noted that the class syntax is just syntax, and not a full-fledged class-based implementation of an object-oriented paradigm, unlike in languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

In ES5, we usually define a constructor function and use the new keyword to instantiate an object.

```JS
var SpaceShuttle = function(targetPlanet){
  this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
}
var zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

The class syntax simply replaces the constructor function creation:

```JS
class SpaceShuttle {
  constructor(targetPlanet) {
    this.targetPlanet = targetPlanet;
  }
}
const zeus = new SpaceShuttle('Jupiter');
```

It should be noted that the class keyword declares a new function, to which a constructor is added. This constructor is invoked when new is called to create a new object.

Note: UpperCamelCase should be used by convention for ES6 class names, as in SpaceShuttle used above.

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.

## Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object

You can obtain values from an object and set the value of a property within an object.

These are classically called getters and setters.

Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.

Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based on the value passed into the setter function. This change could involve calculations, or even overwriting the previous value completely.

```JS
class Book {
  constructor(author) {
    this._author = author;
  }
  // getter
  get writer() {
    return this._author;
  }
  // setter
  set writer(updatedAuthor) {
    this._author = updatedAuthor;
  }
}
const novel = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(novel.writer);
novel.writer = 'newAuthor';
console.log(novel.writer);
```

The console would display the strings anonymous and newAuthor.

Notice the syntax used to invoke the getter and setter. They do not even look like functions. Getters and setters are important because they hide internal implementation details.

Note: It is convention to precede the name of a private variable with an underscore (_). However, the practice itself does not make a variable private.
